# Repo of Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## What is machine learning ?
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. <br>
Frankly, this process is quite basic: find the pattern, apply the pattern. But it pretty much runs the world.

## What is deep learning ?
Deep learning is machine learning on steroids: it uses a technique that gives machines an enhanced ability to find—and amplify—even the smallest patterns.

Blah Blah ....... 

But I can assure you Einstein was wrong at least when he said this, <br>
"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results." <br>
